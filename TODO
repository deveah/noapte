	* dungeon memory separated from player's lightmap

	* screen minimum requirements

	* action point consumption
		* different tiles have different moving cost

	* inventory system

	* in-game messages, such as "Bump!" etc.

	* somehow separate movement from melee attack?

	* real, useful map generator
	
	* combat:
		* natural attacks, ie. "claws" or "kick"
		* tool-based attacks
