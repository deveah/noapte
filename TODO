	Noapte TODO list
	--

High priority:

	* inventory system
	* outdoor map generator
	* ui.drawMainScreen() is far too complex
		* on every tile, there is a check for entities and objects
		* should be separate loops: tile -> object -> entity

Medium priority:

	* action point consumption
		* different tiles have different moving cost
	* combat:
		* natural attacks, ie. "claws" or "kick"
		* tool-based attacks
	* variety added to map generators
	* dungeon memory separated from player's lightmap
		* one lightmap, several maps
		* every map should have a memory

Low priority:

	* screen minimum requirements
	* should message.push also trigger a screen refresh?
