High priority:

	* inventory system
	* real, useful map generator

Medium priority:

	* action point consumption
		* different tiles have different moving cost
	* combat:
		* natural attacks, ie. "claws" or "kick"
		* tool-based attacks
	
Low priority:

	* dungeon memory separated from player's lightmap
	* screen minimum requirements
	* should message.push also trigger a screen refresh?
