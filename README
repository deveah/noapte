	Noapte
	a roguelike in infinite development
	this time in Lua!
	--

	This roguelike is a clear sign of the rewrite disease I have when working
on such games. As with every iteration, I sincerely hope this will get
somewhere.

	To aid me in doing so, I warmly recommend submitting isues, ideas, and
just about any form of contribution.

	May any superior life form out there guide me in bringing this game to a
playable state.
